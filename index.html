    <h1>Mervelous Iceland</h1>
    <h2>Beautiful roadtrip</h2>

    <h2>A place to go</h2>
    <p>An underpopulated island marooned near the top of the globe, Iceland is, literally, a country in the making. It's a vast volcanic laboratory where mighty forces shape the earth: geysers gush, mudpots gloop, ice-covered volcanoes rumble and glaciers cut great pathways through the mountains. Its supercharged splendour seems designed to remind visitors of their utter insignificance in the greater scheme of things. And it works a treat: some crisp clean air, an eyeful of the cinematic landscapes, and everyone is transfixed.</p>
    <h2>Wonderful nature</h2>
    <p>It's the power of Icelandic nature to turn the prosaic into the extraordinary. A dip in a pool becomes a soak in a geothermal lagoon; a casual stroll can transform into a trek across a glittering glacier; and a quiet night of camping may mean front-row seats to the aurora borealisâ€™ curtains of light, or the soft, pinkish hue of the midnight sun. Iceland has a transformative effect on people too â€“ its sagas turned brutes into poets, and its stories of huldufÃ³lk (hidden people) may make believers out of sceptics. Here you'll find some of the world's highest concentrations of dreamers, authors, artists and musicians, all fuelled by their surrounds.</p>
